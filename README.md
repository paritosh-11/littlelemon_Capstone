# littlelemon_Capstone
By working through the lessons in this course, you revisited the necessary concepts and knowledge of back-end development. Using the Django REST Framework, you put your skills into practice to build an API for the Little Lemon restaurant.

You completed exercises, received general instructions and code snippets, and utilized links to resources from previous courses to complete this task.

You demonstrated your web development skills by writing code to create an API that handles table bookings for the Little Lemon restaurant.

The API can receive HTTP requests such as GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, and updates the Django models, which in turn, updates the data in a MySQL database.
